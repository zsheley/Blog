Welcome to my blog! A place where I joke, rant, and journal just about everything.

Ah man today has been quite the rodeo! Zoller, "Bill", and I snatched the fridge from the low end commons during study hall, along with the microwave and all remaining furniture.
At least the high end is furnished now. I also started playing *The Witcher III: Wild Hunt*. Not only was I extremely impressed with the graphics and overall play style of the game, but the story is elegantly written (so far at least). Aside from that and listening to the most prententious conversation I have ever heard between my two absolutle least favorite people, that's been my day. School is a joke, both in-person and online. Teachers tend to ramble on about things barely related to what our focus of study is or they hardly talk at all. Either way it leaves me absolutely clueless in the class. I also don't understand why I HAVE to be in the Zoom call if I'm in-person. I mean really, I'm driving an hour away just to stare at a screen and watch them "lecture" while I'm sitting in the same room. It's whatever, I have until June 18th then I'm gone.

P.S. The car driver is an absolute maniac. I thought her driving was bad freshman year, well it's much much worse. I swear she tried to hit every fucking puddle on the way home today. One of the ones she hit actually woke me up because it felt like we were re-enacting a scene from Tokyo Drift.

Just wanted to make a quick post in appreciation of the MLWGS WiFi. The last time I tried to download 
a 40Gb program at home it took me 3 days. Well, not today, I downloaded the entire Witcher III + all DLC in a matter of 20 mins. If that's not fast I don't know what is.

### The Big Blog

I'm going to make this entry short and sweet because I'm exhausted.

Today I made a blog. It was a pain in the ass. I'll probably forget about said blog in like a week.
The End.

Cheers,
