Welcome to my blog! A place where I joke, rant, and journal just about everything.

### Afternoon Contemplation

I've been trying to figure out what direction I want to take with this blog. So far it's extremely unprofessional and reminds me a lot of Twitter, minus the followers. One part of me wants to dial it back so I don't get flak from potentially important viewers. The other half of me wants to keep it raw. Let's face it, no one is going to continue reading something that lacks flavor. Yet at the same time no one is going to hire or approve of an obvious smart ass. More thought needs to be put into this on my end. Until then, I'll continue writing sloppy uncensored posts about life.

Cheers,  
Sheley

P.S. If you're a future employeer or current employer for that matter please take this blog/site with a grain of salt. No one actuals looks at it anyway, at least I hope not.

### The Liability

MW just had their first fire drill in-person since March of last year. I'm currently in Gov, but since our teacher isn't here in person I'm zooming in the senior commons. I think I'm supposed to be in the cafeteria, but who wants to sit down there with a bunch of freshman? No one has said anything to me yet so I'm just going to play it cool until that day comes. I was really anxious out in the parking lot though. I kept thinking "Uh oh they're looking for me... I'm dead." However, that wasn't the case. At least I don't think it was. Oh well. You live and you learn.

Cheers,

### GOOOOOOOD MORNING VIETNAM!!!!

Fuck, Fuck, Fuck. As usual I woke up completely exhausted so I decided I'd jump start my day with a "little" coffee. It's only 09:50 and I've already drank roughly 4 cups of Starbucks double shot. My limbs refuse to stop moving and my mind is racing. I love it. Thanks Haley for bringing in the Keurig (I hope that's how you spell it)!

Cheers,

### Third Time's the Charm

Ah man today has been quite the rodeo! Zoller, "Bill", and I snatched the fridge from the low end commons during study hall, along with the microwave and all remaining furniture.
At least the high end is furnished now. I also started playing *The Witcher III: Wild Hunt*. Not only was I extremely impressed with the graphics and overall play style of the game, but the story is elegantly written (so far at least). Aside from that and listening to the most prententious conversation I have ever heard between my two absolutle least favorite people, that's been my day. School is a joke, both in-person and online. Teachers tend to ramble on about things barely related to what our focus of study is or they hardly talk at all. Either way it leaves me absolutely clueless in the class. I also don't understand why I HAVE to be in the Zoom call if I'm in-person. I mean really, I'm driving an hour away just to stare at a screen and watch them "lecture" while I'm sitting in the same room. It's whatever, I have until June 18th then I'm gone.

Cheers,

P.S. The car driver is an absolute maniac. I thought her driving was bad freshman year, well it's much much worse. I swear she tried to hit every fucking puddle on the way home today. One of the ones she hit actually woke me up because it felt like we were re-enacting a scene from Tokyo Drift.

### I AM Speed

Just wanted to make a quick post in appreciation of the MLWGS WiFi. The last time I tried to download 
a 40Gb program at home it took me 3 days. Well, not today, I downloaded the entire Witcher III + all DLC in a matter of 20 mins. If that's not fast I don't know what is.

Cheers,

### The Big Blog

I'm going to make this entry short and sweet because I'm exhausted.

Today I made a blog. It was a pain in the ass. I'll probably forget about said blog in like a week.
The End.

Cheers,  
Sheley
