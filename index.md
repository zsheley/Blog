Welcome to my blog! A place where I joke, rant, and journal just about everything.

Just wanted to make a quick post in appreciation of the MLWGS WiFi. The last time I tried to download 
a 40Gb program at home it took me 3 days. Well, not today, I downloaded the entire Witcher III + all DLC in a matter of 20 mins. If that's not fast I don't know what is.

Cheers,

I'm going to make this entry short and sweet because I'm exhausted.

Today I made a blog. It was a pain in the ass. I'll probably forget about said blog in like a week.
The End.

Cheers,
